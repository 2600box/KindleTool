Recommended Compilation Directions

Basically, you'll need a working toolchain, OpenSSL, and libarchive >= 3.0.3 (with gzip support).

To compile for Linux:
	1) Install the dependency packages: zlib-dev, libarchive-dev, libssl-dev (NB: Some distro use the zlib1g name for zlib...)
	2) Compile using "make" in the tool's directory

To compile for OSX:
	1) Get MacPorts
	2) Install the package: openssl
	3) Setup a local portfile repository (http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories) based on the one found in the ports folder (AFAIK, MacPorts default prefix in /opt/local).
	3B) Don't forget to properly edit MacPorts' sources.conf file, and to run portindex in the root of your repository
	4) Install the package: libarchive (You should end hopefully end up with libarchive-3.0.4, if you properly setup your portfile repo ;))
	5) Open the Xcode 4 project and compile (Or compile using "make" in the tool's directory)

To compile for Windows:
	1) Get Cygwin
	2) Install the required packages for a proper toolchain (gcc4, binutils, autoconf, automake, libtool, make, ...)
	3) Install the packages: libopenssl100 / openssl-devel, zlib / zlib-devel, git
	4) Compile and install libarchive >= 3.0.3
	4.1) I recommend a minimal build configured via
		./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-static --enable-shared --disable-xattr --disable-acl --with-zlib --without-bz2lib --without-lzmadec --without-iconv --without-lzma --without-nettle --without-expat --without-xml2
	4.2) If you want to download it via wget from the Cygwin shell, you'll have to install wget/curl, and jump through a few hoops to setup the SSL CA certs... (google is your friend).
	5) Compile using "make" in the tool's directory

Fellow Gentoo users, there's an ebuild right here, put it in your local overlay as dev-util/kindletool and enjoy ;).
