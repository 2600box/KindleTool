Recommended Compilation Directions

Basically, you'll need a working toolchain, OpenSSL, and libarchive (with tar & gzip support).

To compile for Linux:
	1) Install the dependency packages: libarchive-dev, libssl-dev
	2) Compile using "make" in the tool's directory

To compile for OSX:
	1) Get MacPorts
	2) Install the packages: libarchive, openssl
	3) Open the Xcode 4 project and compile

To compile for Windows:
	1) Get Cygwin
	2) Install the packages: openssl-devel
	3) Compile and install libarchive
	4) Compile using "make" in the tool's directory

Fellow Gentoo users, there's an ebuild right here, put it in your local overlay as dev-util/kindletool and enjoy ;).

NOTE: This fork is probably broken on everything except Linux x86/arm.
Patches/Pull requests to fix that are welcome :).

TODO:
  * Restore 'if input is a single tgz file, assume it's properly built, and just sign, munge & package it' support
  * Recap to stderr (in order not to mess up the output to stdout stuff) what we're actually creating
