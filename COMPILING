Recommended Compilation Directions

Basically, you'll need a working toolchain, OpenSSL, and libarchive >= 3.0.3 (with gzip support).

To compile for Linux:
	1) Install the dependency packages: libarchive-dev, libssl-dev
	2) Compile using "make" in the tool's directory

To compile for OSX:
	1) Get MacPorts
	2) Install the package: openssl
	3) Compile and install libarchive >= 3.0.3 (the version available in MacPorts/Fink is outdated and Homebrew didn't have a libarchive formula at the time of writing)
	4) Open the Xcode 4 project and compile

To compile for Windows:
	1) Get Cygwin
	2) Install the packages: openssl-devel
	3) Compile and install libarchive >= 3.0.3
	4) Compile using "make" in the tool's directory

Fellow Gentoo users, there's an ebuild right here, put it in your local overlay as dev-util/kindletool and enjoy ;).

NOTE: This fork is probably broken on everything except Linux x86/arm.
Patches/Pull requests to fix that are welcome :).
