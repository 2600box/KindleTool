Recommended Compilation Directions

Basically, you'll need a working toolchain, OpenSSL, and libarchive >= 3.0.3 (with gzip support).

To compile for Linux:
	1) Install the dependency packages: libarchive-dev, libssl-dev
	2) Compile using "make" in the tool's directory

To compile for OSX:
	1) Get MacPorts
	2) Install the package: openssl
	3) Compile and install libarchive >= 3.0.3 (the version available in MacPorts/Fink is outdated and Homebrew didn't have a libarchive formula at the time of writing)
	4) Open the Xcode 4 project and compile

To compile for Windows:
	1) Get Cygwin
	2) Install the required packages for a proper toolchain (gcc4, binutils, autoconf, automake, libtool, make, ...)
	3) Install the packages: libopenssl100 / openssl-devel, zlib / zlib-devel, git
	4) Compile and install libarchive >= 3.0.3
	4.1) I recommend a minimal build configured via
		./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-static --enable-shared --disable-xattr --disable-acl --with-zlib --without-bz2lib --without-lzmadec --without-iconv --without-lzma --without-nettle --without-expat --without-xml2
	4.2) If you want to download it via wget from the Cygwin shell, you'll have to install wget/curl, and jump through a few hoops to setup the SSL CA certs... (google is your friend).
	5) Compile using "make" in the tool's directory

Fellow Gentoo users, there's an ebuild right here, put it in your local overlay as dev-util/kindletool and enjoy ;).

NOTE: This fork is probably broken on everything except Linux x86/x86_64/arm, Cygwin x86.
Patches/Pull requests to fix that are welcome :).
