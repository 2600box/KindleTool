* Handle 'fake' userdata packages on extract... (ie. use getopt)

* Use pkgconfig to detect OpenSSL or Nettle in version.sh

* Link to Nettle statically in the binary builds

* Move to nettle (2.7, the sha headers were split in 2.6)
	* pkg-config hogweed --libs --static (use static to pull nettle & gmp, which we need)

* Add a Nettle/OpenSSL tag to the version command

* Do it w/ ifdef for now, allowing to still build against OpenSSL
	* But prefer nettle
	* Depend on nettle[gmp] on Gentoo
	* Do it in a branch

* So, yeah, we'll need to build gmp for the static builds

* Be able to FORCE_NETTLE in the Makefile to bypass pkg-config (static builds)

* See if we need to do something special to have clean valgrind output with nettle
